mov ah, 0x0e

; attempt 1
; Fails because it tries to print the memory address (i.e. pointer)
; not its actual contents

; print 1

; print E(X ptr, 0x45)

; attempt 2
; It tries to print the memory address of 'the_secret' which is the correct approach.
; However, BIOS places our bootsector binary at address 0x7c00
; so we need to add that padding beforehand. We'll do that in attempt 3
; print 2

; print Â°(random char)

call newline

; attempt 3
; Add the BIOS starting offset 0x7c00 to the memory address of the X
; and then dereference the contents of that pointer.
; We need the help of a different register 'bx' because 'mov al, [ax]' is illegal.
; A register can't be used as source and destination for the same command.

; attempt 4
; We try a shortcut since we know that the X is stored at byte 0x45 in our binary
; That's smart but ineffective, we don't want to be recounting label offsets
; every time we change the code
